The Humanizer app follows a Freemium model. When users land on the homepage, they have two options: sign up for free or choose a paid plan.

- If a user selects a paid plan, they are first redirected to the authentication page. After authentication, they are taken directly to the Paddle billing page with the same plan they selected before signing in, ensuring a seamless payment process.

- If a user starts with the free plan, they can use the app with limited functionality. Once they exceed the free usage limit, a popup will appear, prompting them to upgrade. This popup will redirect them to the pricing page, where they can select a paid plan.
